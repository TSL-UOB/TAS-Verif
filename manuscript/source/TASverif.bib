Traditional approaches to certification require the software, its systems context, and all their associated assurance artifacts to be available for scrutiny in their final, completed forms. But modern development practices often postpone the determination of final system configuration from design time to integration time, load time, or even runtime. Adaptive systems go beyond this and modify or synthesize functions at runtime.",
