\section{Introduction}


The use of AI-enabled and autonomous systems is pervasive in current society and is set to become even more so with current technological growth trends and adoption rates. Systems with embedded AI and machine learning (ML) algorithms can be found in numerous applications from mobile phones\footnote{\url{https://medium.com/gobeyond-ai/artificial-intelligence-ai-in-mobile-phones-is-it-a-good-thing-fe044f20ea6c}} and vacuum cleaners\footnote{\url{https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/01/ecovacs-robotics-ai-robotic-vacuum.html}} to medical diagnostics~\cite{kononenko2001machine}.
