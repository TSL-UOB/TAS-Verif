Working title:
Challenges to Assessing the Trustworthiness of Autonomous Systems

Overview:
This will be a 2-3 page 'checklist' style paper that will outline the challenges to verifying autonomous systems. The literature review will outline the major trustworthy criteria and these must be filtered and ordered for the particular application based on input from the trust stakeholders. The main part of the paper deals with the assessment of those criteria against the specifications, how this can be achieved, what the metrics are and the standards by which they can be judged. Analysis of the results will allow 'trust engineers' to see where the system may fail to meet minimum standards or where there is a miscalibration to the user requiring corrective action prior to deployment. Operational systems should have some level of runtime monitoring especially if the system is allowed to functionally evolve where human oversight will be neccessary.
